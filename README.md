Rainbow colored loading spinner for AngularJS.

Uses canvas, rAF and magic unicorns. Not very well tested or anything, but looks cool if it works.

- Adjusts its size to the parent container and has position: absolute baked into it, other than that it needs minimum styling to get right (ex. left: '15 px';).
- Has some settings, and the fidelity is by default tuned to 60fps, check the source though, there's some settings to play with
- see demo for usage
